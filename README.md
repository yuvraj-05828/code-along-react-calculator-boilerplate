### Learning Goals:

To understanding the importance of: 

1. re-renders
2. state management
3. breaking down your code into components.

This lab also gives you an opportunity to experiment around `hooks`, that you have learned till now.

### Task:

Your task is to create a simple calculator.

`Constraints`: you should not use any libraries for creating the logic of calculator.

Here is a demo, as how your output should look like. ( the UI may not be `exactly` the same.)
